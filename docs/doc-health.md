# Documentation Health — kashi

> **Last refresh**: 2026-05-27 (0.1.0 baseline + post-0.1.0 P(-1) hardening:
> `docs/audit/` and `docs/benchmarks*` now exist; CHANGELOG/state refreshed).
> **Refresh cadence**: when a doc is touched, update its row. Full-tree
> sweep at minor-version closeouts.
>
> **Scope**: this repo only (`kashi`) — the `docs/` tree plus root-level
> files (README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY,
> CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, VERSION, cyrius.cyml). Sibling-repo docs are not
> audited here. Cross-repo version drift lives in [`development/state.md`](development/state.md).
>
> **Location**: `docs/doc-health.md` (whole-tree scope), **not** under
> `docs/development/` — the ledger sweeps the whole tree and the location
> matches the scope.

This is a **ledger**, not a one-time audit. Rewrite-in-place as docs change.
Small repo (well under the ~30-file threshold), so the ledger stays narrow;
if `docs/` grows past ~30 files, switch to tier roll-ups like the agnosticos
pattern.

| `CLAUDE.md` | 2026-05-27 | ✅ Fresh | Durable-only; freestanding-vs-full-lib split, one-owner/two-faces boundary discipline, standard constraints. State deferred to state.md. |

## Carry-forward / open items

- ~~**`docs/audit/`**~~ — ✅ created 2026-05-27 (`2026-05-27-audit.md`, first
  P(-1) pass). Re-audit when M2 fonts / PSF import land.
- ~~**`docs/benchmarks.md`**~~ — ✅ created 2026-05-27, CSV-backed
  (`benchmarks/history.csv`). 0.1.0 is the first row; append per release to
  build the version-over-version trend.
- **`docs/api/`** — defer until the library face (PSF import, registry) lands
  and the surface is large enough that grepping beats reading.
